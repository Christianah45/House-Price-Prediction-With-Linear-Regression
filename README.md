# Project Title: House-Price-Prediction-With-Linear-Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on estimating house prices using Linear Regression and demonstrates a complete data analysis and modeling pipeline. From raw data to final predictions, the project emphasizes data understanding, model interpretation, and performance evaluation, which are essential skills for real-world analytics and business use cases.
Rather than only fitting a model, the project highlights how exploratory analysis and thoughtful evaluation contribute to building meaningful and explainable predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was carried out to understand the structure and behavior of the dataset before modeling. Key steps included:
•	Analyzing the distribution of house prices to understand spread and skewness

•	Visualizing relationships between individual features and house prices

•	Identifying patterns that suggest which variables have stronger influence on price

These visual insights helped validate assumptions required for linear regression and guided feature selection.

## Model Development & Evaluation
A Linear Regression model was trained to predict house prices based on selected features.
Performance Metrics Used:
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average prediction error

•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Interpretable error magnitude

•	R² Score: Indicates how much variance in house prices is explained by the model

## Results Summary:
•	RMSE ≈ 4.93 units, indicating reasonable prediction accuracy

•	R² ≈ 0.67, meaning the model explains about 67% of price variation

The model serves as a strong baseline and demonstrates effective use of regression for price estimation tasks.

## Key Insights
•	Certain features show a clear linear relationship with house prices

•	Visualization greatly improves understanding of feature impact

•	Linear Regression provides interpretability, making it useful for business decision-making

•	Further improvements are possible through feature engineering and advanced models
________________________________________
## Future Enhancements
•	Experiment with regularized models such as Ridge and Lasso Regression

•	Apply cross-validation to improve generalization

•	Test non-linear models like Random Forest for performance comparison

•	Deploy the model as a simple web application using Streamlit or Flask
